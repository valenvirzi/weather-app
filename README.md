# Weather App

A weather app built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to search for the weather in different cities, display current weather data, and see a 5-day forecast. The app fetches data from multiple APIs, including a geocoding API, current weather API, and a 5-day forecast API.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can search for a city to get its weather information.
- **Current Weather**: Displays the current weather, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Shows a daily forecast with weather data for the next five days.
- **Local Storage**: Stores weather data in `localStorage` so the app can render the last selected city's weather information on reload.
- **Chart Display**: Visualizes daily temperature trends using a line chart built with Chart.js.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS.
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses Framer Motion for smooth and interactive animations throughout the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the app.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience and reliability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering the daily temperature chart.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations and transitions in React apps.
